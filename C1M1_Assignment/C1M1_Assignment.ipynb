    "### 3.3 Define the Tasks for each Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have set up your agents, you are ready to define the tasks each of them will perform. In particular you will need three tasks (one for each agent):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Analysis Task**: Evaluate code changes for style, bugs, and maintainability, deciding which issues must be fixed before approval. \n",
    "     \n",
    "- **Security Review Task**: Examine code for security vulnerabilities, determining risk levels and whether security issues should block approval. \n",
    "     \n",
    "- **Review Decision Task**: Analyze the quality and security findings to decide if changes can be automatically approved, need specific fixes, or require human review. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### General guidelines for creating Tasks:\n",
    "When creating each task, you'll need to define these key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `description`: A clear explanation of what the task involves\n",
    "- `expected_output`: The format and content the task should produce\n",
    "- `agent`: Which agent will perform this task\n",
    "- `context` (optional): Define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task. You can learn more about context in the [docs](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/tasks#referring-to-other-tasks). In this case, you will only need to set the context for the last task."
